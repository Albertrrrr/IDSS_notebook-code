Extract from the University of Glasgow Plagiarism Statement
- 31.1 The University's degrees and other academic awards are given in recognition of a student's personal achievement.
All work submitted by students for assessment is accepted on the understanding that it is the student's own effort.
- 31.2 Plagiarism is defined as the submission or presentation of work, in any form, which is not one's own, without 
acknowledgement of the sources. Plagiarism includes inappropriate collaboration with others. Special cases of plagiarism 
can arise from a student using his or her own previous work (termed auto-plagiarism or self-plagiarism). Auto-plagiarism 
includes using work that has already been submitted for assessment at this University or for any other academic award.
- 31.3 The incorporation of material without formal and proper acknowledgement (even with no deliberate intent to cheat) 
can constitute plagiarism.
Work may be considered to be plagiarised if it consists of:
- a direct quotation;
- a close paraphrase;
- an unacknowledged summary of a source;
- direct copying or transcription.

With regard to essays, reports and dissertations, the rule is: if information or ideas are obtained from any source, 
that source must be acknowledged according to the appropriate convention in that discipline; and any direct 
quotation must be placed in quotation marks and the source cited immediately. Any failure to acknowledge 
adequately or to cite properly other sources in submitted work is plagiarism. Under examination conditions, 
material learnt by rote or close paraphrase will be expected to follow the usual rules of reference citation 
otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism. Departments should provide guidance on other appropriate use of 
references in examination conditions.
- 31.4 Plagiarism is considered to be an act of fraudulence and an offence against University discipline. Alleged 
plagiarism, at whatever stage of a student's studies, whether before or after graduation, will be investigated and 
dealt with appropriately by the University.
- 31.5 The University reserves the right to use plagiarism detection systems, which may be externally based, in the 
interests of improving academic standards when assessing student work.
